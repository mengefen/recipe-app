# Recipe App - Ruby on Rails

The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It allows to save ingredients, keep track of what the user have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what the user have and what current user are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow the user to make them public so anyone can access them.
